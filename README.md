<h3><b>Task 1 : Prediction of Score of Student based on Study Hours</b></h3>
<h4> This project aims at making such a system that is able to predict the Score of Students based on number of hours he puts in daily consistantly. This project is built using Linear Regression model in Supervised Machine Learning.
<br>
This Project includes-
<br> <br>
<ul>
<li> Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Data Analysis of a Score_Hours Dataset provided by The Sparks Foundation. 
<li> A Linear Regression Model is created that is capable of predicting the score of the Student if we input the number of study hours.
<li> The created model is also evaluated and checked for accuracy.
</ul> <br> <br>
<h3><b>Task 2 : From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually. </b></h3>
<h4> This project aims at making such a system that is able to predict the optimum number of clusters. This project is built using KMeans Clustering method in Unsupervised Machine Learning.
<br>
This Project includes-
<br> <br>
<ul>
<li> Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Data Analysis of a Iris Dataset provided by The Sparks Foundation. 
<li> Optimum Number of clusters are calculated using Elbow Method.
<li> The Dataset is then categorized into 3 clusters based on the type of the flower.
  <li> All the clusters are distinguishable and are visuallized clearly.
</ul>
